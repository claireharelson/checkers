Approach: I started by reading in the two game files using the 'readlines' function. I then used the 'strip' and
'split' functions to organize the data properly so that I could manipulate it. Next I created a nested list that split
the red moves and black moves apart. I then created several variables and set their totals to zero so that I could
start a count for the game moves. I used a 'for' loop to iterate over all the moves in the game, starting with red. I
used an if/elif/else statement to determine what each move was and total up the score accordingly and print the proper
statements. I set my loop up to break as soon as one of the colors reached a total of 12. Last, I used an f string in
a print statement to produce the desired game score output.
